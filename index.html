        <p>This page seems empty at the moment, but it will soon have good content, there is plenty of it, I simply had
        nowhere to publish it before. Creating a blog, even a the simplest kind like this one, takes a lot of time which
        is always in very short supply.</p>

        <p>I have technical essays about Python, Go, Common Lisp, AWS and more. Short stories many of which are fiction.
        Plenty of educational content too. Anecdotes and a lot of accumulated experience to share. I also make silly
        drawings and sometimes record harmless basslines, all in good fun. It is a pity I did not find time to get to
        publishing all of this earlier. At the moment only the <a href="quotes.html">quotes page</a> is present with
        some of my favourites.</p>

        <p> Well, back to fleshing all of this out, meanwhile have a good day.</p>
