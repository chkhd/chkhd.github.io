    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.</p>
        <p>—George Bernard Shaw</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>If you only do what you can do, you will never be more than who you are.</p>
        <p>—Master Shifu, Kun-Fu Panda 3</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>What you learn from others you can use to follow. What you learn for yourself you can use to lead.</p>
        <p>—Richard W. Hamming</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>Beware of finding what you're looking for.</p>
        <p>—Richard W. Hamming</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>Indeed, one of my major complaints about the computer field is that whereas Newton could say, "If I have seen
        a little farther than others, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants," I am forced to say, "Today
        we stand on each other's feet." Perhaps <strong>the central problem we face in all of computer science is how we
        are to get to the situation where we build on top of the work of others</strong> rather than redoing so much of
        it in a trivially different way. <strong>Science is supposed to be cumulative, not almost endless duplication of
        the same kind of things.</strong></p>
        <p>—Richard W. Hamming</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>If you don’t work on important problems, it’s not likely that you'll do important work.</p>
        <p>—Richard W. Hamming</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>In science if you know what you are doing you should not be doing it. In engineering if you do not know what
        you are doing you should not be doing it.</p>
        <p>—Richard W. Hamming</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to
        what the world is and what might be important.</p>
        <p>—Richard W. Hamming</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>Teachers should prepare the student for the student's future, not for the teacher's past.</p>
        <p>—Richard W. Hamming</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>Often it is not physical limitations... but rather it is human made laws, habits, and organizational rules,
        regulations, personal egos, and inertia, which dominate the evolution of the future.</p>
        <p>—Richard W. Hamming</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right with n independent random steps will,
        on the average, end up about square root of n steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one
        direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to n. In a
        lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, **a career with a vision will get you a distance
        proportional to n, while no vision will get you only the distance square root of n. ** In a sense, the main
        difference between those who go far and those who do not is some people have a vision and the others do not and
        therefore can only react to the current events as they happen. <strong>The accuracy of the vision matters less
        than you suppose, getting anywhere is better than drifting</strong>, there are potentially many paths to
        greatness for you... <strong>No vision, not much of a future.</strong></p>
        <p>—Richard W. Hamming</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>You ought to try to make significant contributions to humanity rather than just get along through life
        comfortably... the life of trying to achieve excellence in some area is in itself a worthy goal... A life
        without a struggle on your part to make yourself excellent is hardly a life worth living. ...a life without such
        a goal... is merely existing…</p>
        <p>—Richard W. Hamming</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>Buddha told his disciples, "Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it, no matter if I have
        said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense". I say the same to you -<strong>you
        must assume the responsibility for what you believe.</strong></p>
        <p>—Richard W. Hamming</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>Typing is no substitute for thinking.</p>
        <p>—Richard W. Hamming</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>Often the great scientists, by turning the problem around a bit, changed a defect to an asset. <strong>For
        example, many scientists when they found they couldn't do a problem finally began to study why not</strong>.
        They then turned it around the other way and said, “But of course, this is what it is” and got an important
        result.</p>
        <p>—Richard W. Hamming</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>One of the characteristics of successful scientists is having courage. Once you get your courage up and
        believe that you can do important problems, then you can. If you think you can't, almost surely you are not
        going to.</p>
        <p>—Richard W. Hamming</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>Luck favours the prepared mind.</p>
        <p>—Luis Pasteur</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>It is a poor workman who blames his tools—the good man gets on with the job, given what he's got, and gets
        the best answer he can.</p>
        <p>—Richard W. Hamming</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the
        one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more
        productive over a lifetime.</p>
        <p>—Richard W. Hamming</p>
    </div>

        <p>Change breaks the brittle.</p>
        <p>—Jan Houtema</p>

        <p>—Abelson &amp; Sussman</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>Don't worry about what anybody else is going to do. The best way to predict the future is to invent it.</p>
        <p>—Alan Kay</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>The best writing is rewriting.</p>
        <p>—E. B. White</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special cases.</p>
        <p>—Jon Bentley and Doug McIlroy</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>Your twenties are always an apprenticeship, but you don't always know what for.</p>
        <p>—Jan Houtema</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great
        make you feel that you, too, can become great.</p>
        <p>—Mark Twain</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">

        <p>A large system produced by expanding the dimensions of a smaller system does not behave like the smaller
        system.</p>
        <p>—John Gall, Systemantics</p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">

    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>A woodcutter strained to saw down a tree. A young man who was watching asked “What are you doing?” “Are you
        blind?” the woodcutter replied. “I’m cutting down this tree.” The young man was unabashed. “You look exhausted!
        Take a break. Sharpen your saw.” The woodcutter explained to the young man that he had been sawing for hours and
        did not have time to take a break. The young man pushed back… “If you sharpen the saw, you would cut down the
        tree much faster.” The woodcutter said “I don’t have time to sharpen the saw. Don’t you see I’m too busy?”</p>

    <div class="message-body quote">
        <p>The requirement for all writers is to know just what meaning they want to convey, and it is only by clothing

    </div>
    <div class="message-body quote">
