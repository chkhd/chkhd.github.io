        Quotes that have and still continue to inspire me. I think wisdom in most of them can be appreciated readily,
        but personally I had to be in the right place at the right time to <i>truly</i> understand some of them.

        <p class="quote-body">Indeed, one of my major complaints about the computer field is that whereas Newton could
            say, "If I have seen
            a little farther than others, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants," I am forced to say,
            "Today
            we stand on each other's feet." Perhaps <i>the central problem we face in all of computer science is how we
                are to get to the situation where we build on top of the work of others</i> rather than redoing so much
            of
            it in a trivially different way. <i>Science is supposed to be cumulative, not almost endless duplication of
                the same kind of things.</i></p>

    <div class="quote">
        <p class="quote-body">If you don’t work on important problems, it’s not likely that you'll do important
            work.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="quote">
        <p class="quote-body">In science if you know what you are doing you should not be doing it. In engineering if
            you do not know what
            you are doing you should not be doing it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="quote">
        <p class="quote-body">He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally
            gets clues as to
            what the world is and what might be important.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="quote">
        <p class="quote-body">Often it is not physical limitations... but rather it is human made laws, habits, and
            organizational rules,
            regulations, personal egos, and inertia, which dominate the evolution of the future.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="quote">
        <p class="quote-body">It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right with n independent
            random steps will,
            on the average, end up about square root of n steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one
            direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to n. In
            a
            lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, **a career with a vision will get you a
            distance
            proportional to n, while no vision will get you only the distance square root of n. ** In a sense, the main
            difference between those who go far and those who do not is some people have a vision and the others do not
            and
            therefore can only react to the current events as they happen. <i>The accuracy of the vision matters less
                than you suppose, getting anywhere is better than drifting</i>, there are potentially many paths to
            greatness for you... <i>No vision, not much of a future.</i></p>

        <p class="quote-body">You ought to try to make significant contributions to humanity rather than just get along
            through life
            comfortably... the life of trying to achieve excellence in some area is in itself a worthy goal... A life
            without a struggle on your part to make yourself excellent is hardly a life worth living. ...a life without
            such
            a goal... is merely existing…</p>

        <p class="quote-body">Buddha told his disciples, "Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it,
            no matter if I have
            said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense". I say the same to you -<i>you
                must assume the responsibility for what you believe.</i></p>

    <div class="quote">
        <p class="quote-body">Often the great scientists, by turning the problem around a bit, changed a defect to an
            asset. <i>For
                example, many scientists when they found they couldn't do a problem finally began to study why not</i>.
            They then turned it around the other way and said, “But of course, this is what it is” and got an important
            result.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="quote">
        <p class="quote-body">One of the characteristics of successful scientists is having courage. Once you get your
            courage up and
            believe that you can do important problems, then you can. If you think you can't, almost surely you are not
            going to.</p>

    <div class="quote">
        <p class="quote-body">It is a poor workman who blames his tools—the good man gets on with the job, given what
            he's got, and gets
            the best answer he can.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="quote">
        <p class="quote-body">Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest. Given two people with exactly the
            same ability, the
            one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more
            productive over a lifetime.</p>

        <p class="quote-body">A woodcutter strained to saw down a tree. A young man who was watching asked “What are you
            doing?” “Are you
            blind?” the woodcutter replied. “I’m cutting down this tree.” The young man was unabashed. “You look
            exhausted!
            Take a break. Sharpen your saw.” The woodcutter explained to the young man that he had been sawing for hours
            and
            did not have time to take a break. The young man pushed back… “If you sharpen the saw, you would cut down
            the
            tree much faster.” The woodcutter said “I don’t have time to sharpen the saw. Don’t you see I’m too
            busy?”</p>
