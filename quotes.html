        <p class="quote-body">Indeed, one of my major complaints about the computer field is that whereas Newton could
            say, "If I have seen
            a little farther than others, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants," I am forced to say,
            "Today
            we stand on each other's feet." Perhaps <i>the central problem we face in all of computer science is how we
                are to get to the situation where we build on top of the work of others</i> rather than redoing so much
            of
            it in a trivially different way. <i>Science is supposed to be cumulative, not almost endless duplication of
                the same kind of things.</i></p>

        <p class="quote-body">It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right with n independent
            random steps will,
            on the average, end up about square root of n steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one
            direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to n. In
            a
            lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, **a career with a vision will get you a
            distance
            proportional to n, while no vision will get you only the distance square root of n. ** In a sense, the main
            difference between those who go far and those who do not is some people have a vision and the others do not
            and
            therefore can only react to the current events as they happen. <i>The accuracy of the vision matters less
                than you suppose, getting anywhere is better than drifting</i>, there are potentially many paths to
            greatness for you... <i>No vision, not much of a future.</i></p>

            asset. <i>For
                example, many scientists when they found they couldn't do a problem finally began to study why not</i>.
            They then turned it around the other way and said, “But of course, this is what it is” and got an important
